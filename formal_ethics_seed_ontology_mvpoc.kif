;; Draft six is the final draft of my full-engagement with the (Pseudo)-Formal Ethics Seed Ontology Project. 
;; English descriptions, discussions, and some important SUMO can be found on the website: https://gardenofminds.art/ethics/formal-ethics-seed-ontology/

;; Disclaimer: the code has not been thoroughly checked for errors via export to TPTP and ATPs (nor to HO SET via Megalodon and ATPs).
;; Further, some progressions of versions of definitions remain in this file.  The versions on the Wiki are generally the best drafts (however, sometimes they may simply be the most presentable, not the most interesting).
;; It may be that in practice one should include "instance $INSTANCE $CLASS" for most variables, yet I prefer leaving it out when the types should be easy to disambiguate to avoid cluttering the rules.

;; The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is a heavily used source.

;; Functional Utilities

;; A personal didactic lesson is that many "standard tools" of functional and logic program are needed in order to do formalization.
;; I think sticking to the ontology-level doesn't save on frome this necessity, unless one remains in shallow waters with a small knowedgebase.

;; Helper function to wield Classes as 'objects' (aka sets).
;; Inspired by the translation of SUMKO-K into higher-order set theory by Chad Brown, Adam Pease, and Josef Urban.
;; Also due to a need to "make decisions over classes of processes" yet to have this "class" be an "object" of a process, aka a set.
;; Translating SUMO-K to Higher-Order Set Theory: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43369-6_14

;; Target-Centred Virtue Ethics (TCVE) (or something in that rough ballpark)
;;
;; While this is arguably a specific example theory or alternative to standard virtue ethics, figuring out how to frame it involved updating some of the formalisms for the other paradigms.
;; Further, TCVE includes some aspects by default that other paradigms probably need to include to be practically applied.
;; Thus there is further value in examining teh formalization (attempt).

;;  A core idea I see is:
;; Virtuous acts are defined by reference to how virtuous people approach challenging domains.
;; Virtuous people are defined by reference to how well they exhibit virtuous acts in the challenging domains.
;; This is an iterative learning and refinement process.
;; 
;; Agent-centric virtue ethics focuses on the virtuous agents.
;; Target-centric virtue ethics focuses on the nature of the virtuous acts.
;; 
;; To this end, the following are specified:
;; The "field" or challenging domain in which a given virtue is relevant.
;; The "mode" of response of the given virtue to this challenge.
;; The "basis" on which this mode/type of response is deemed virtuous: some values.
;; The "target" that denotes a successful response to the challenge at hand.
;;
;; I'm referencing primarily Christine Swanton's Virtue Ethics: A Pluralistic View,
;; as well as SEP.  I find some descriptions of this factorization less clear than desired.
;; So the proof-of-concept trying to connect the plugs with this ontology may be lacking in some regards.
;;
;; As I've defined Virtue Ethics theries, they'll all be agent-centric.
;; Modifying SimpleVirtueSentence to attribue virtue attributes to agents or behaviors, 
;; or to classes thereof, would be one way to solve this if desired.
;; I'm not personally so sold on the superiority of target-centric virtue ethics, 
;; but this is a good lesson that the high-level ontology should be very broad to 
;; incorporate a broad range of theories!
;;
;; A reasonable review that helps to elucidate the concepts (perhaps better than the book iteslf, imo): 
;; https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/target-centred-virtue-ethics/

;; Ok, now that I added this part, (hasPurposeInArgumentFor ?S ?VES),
;; I can turn this into a type of virtue ethics!

;; 1) Intentional Aspirations of Virtue X

;; Ok, I think I want to define one with a simple situatinoal action value judgment sentence.
;; Basically, declaring the existence of the field and mode.
;; How to translate from, "Bob is Honest" to "it's good to take honest actions"?  You don't.
;; You'd say, "it's good to do what an honest person would do."
;; Where should the modal operator lie?  "It is good {to do what an honest person would do}"?
;; Or "It is good {to do X} where X is what an honest person would do"?
;; I think the latter is better as it doesn't just "refer back to the virtue".  It "unpacks" it.
;; And that's what I have.  So no change.

;; and other fields, that a person must have sufficient information and understanding 
;; before making decisions about accepting risk, such as their medical care. 
;; Pertinent information may include risks and benefits of treatments, alternative 
;; treatments, the patient's role in treatment, and their right to refuse treatment."

;; So, all surgeons hold the obligation to, for all surgeries they perform, to 
;; have received approval for the surgery to take place from the patient prior to 
;; the surgery.  An explanation ('communication') and understanding ('interpreting') 
;; should take place prior to the approval.  (Weirdly, 'explanation' is a 'deductive argument' in SUMO.)

;; involved.  Or if being dutiful/pietal, simply following the law.
;; Utilitarians would evaulate each surgery on a case-by-case basis unless working through 
;; Rule Utilitarianism, in which case the protocol of informed consent would probably remain as it is.
;; This is probably a case where the deontological approach is the 'most natural'!
;; However, in real life, people probably understand both Virtue and Utilitarian paradigms, too,
