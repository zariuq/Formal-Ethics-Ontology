# Formalization of Ethical Theory

This repository contains the (semi)-formal part of the [Formal Ethics Seed Ontology](https://gardenofminds.art/esowiki/main/) project, which is written in SUO-KIF language and uses the [SUMO ontology](https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo).

Please see the [Wiki](https://gardenofminds.art/esowiki/main/) for most of the information on the project and its motivations.  The Wiki also contains English discussions and definitions along with the major formal definitions.

#### Contents of the Repository:

The final draft of my full-time involvement in the project is the file, "formal_ethics_seed_ontology_mvpoc.kif".

There are two presentations at the [AITP](http://aitp-conference.org/) conference of the initial project proposal and the state of the project at the in 2022 and 2023, along with the extended abstract from 2022.  Contained in the obvious folder.

There is an overly simplified initial example generating some pretty proof pictures on the topic of whether a surgeon is ethically permitted to perform an organ transplant.

The incrementally updated versions of the formalization are also stored in the Additional Kifs folder.  Some interesting, fun explorations (such as playing with how LLMAgents might be introduced) are commented out at the end of the main kif file.
