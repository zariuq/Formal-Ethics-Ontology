# Formalization-of-Ethical-Theory
Notes on the formalization of ethical theory, which should help with analyses and reasoning about AI safety and ethics.

A SUMO example of a simple ethical dilemma concerning organ transplants is in transplant_fo.kif

The 'proof' that the surgery takes place when there is informed consent is in the file deont_proof_with_consent.gif

There are three "base level inferences" in a first-order form.

1) In the deontology case, the surgery happens when there is informed consent (and otherwise there's no specification).

2) In the virtue ethics case, the surgery happens when there is consent and the surgeon is practically wise (a virtue).

3) In the utilitarian case, the surgery happens if and only if the utility after the surgery is greater than the utility prior to the surgery.
