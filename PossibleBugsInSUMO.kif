;; Possible bugs in SUMO


;;I noticed an additional bug requiring summing the monetary value of each element of the set. I'll save that fix for later ^^;

(domain monetaryValue 1 Physical)
(=>
(equal
(WealthFn ?PERSON) ?AMOUNT)
(monetaryValue
(PropertyFn ?PERSON) ?AMOUNT))

(=>
(monetaryValue
(PropertyFn ?PERSON) ?AMOUNT)
(equal
(WealthFn ?PERSON) ?AMOUNT))
