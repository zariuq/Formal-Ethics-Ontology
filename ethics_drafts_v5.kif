;;
;; Target-Centred Virtue Ethics (or something in that rough ballpark)
;;

;;  A core idea I see is:
;; Virtuous acts are defined by reference to how virtuous people approach challenging domains.
;; Virtuous people are defined by reference to how well they exhibit virtuous acts in the challenging domains.
;; This is an iterative learning and refinement process.
;; 
;; Agent-centric virtue ethics focuses on the virtuous agents.
;; Target-centric virtue ethics focuses on the nature of the virtuous acts.
;; 
;; To this end, the following are specified:
;; The "field" or challenging domain in which a given virtue is relevant.
;; The "mode" of response of the given virtue to this challenge.
;; The "basis" on which this mode/type of response is deemed virtuous: some values.
;; The "target" that denotes a successful response to the challenge at hand.
;;
;; I'm referencing primarily Christine Swanton's Virtue Ethics: A Pluralistic View,
;; as well as SEP.  I find some descriptions of this factorization less clear than desired.
;; So the proof-of-concept trying to connect the plugs with this ontology may be lacking in some regards.
;;
;; As I've defined Virtue Ethics theries, they'll all be agent-centric.
;; Modifying SimpleVirtueSentence to attribue virtue attributes to agents or behaviors, 
;; or to classes thereof, would be one way to solve this if desired.
;; I'm not personally so sold on the superiority of target-centric virtue ethics, 
;; but this is a good lesson that the high-level ontology should be very broad to 
;; incorporate a broad range of theories!
;;
;; A reasonable review that helps to elucidate the concepts (perhaps better than the book iteslf, imo): 
;; https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/target-centred-virtue-ethics/

;; Ok, now that I added this part, (hasPurposeInArgumentFor ?S ?VES),
;; I can turn this into a type of virtue ethics!

;;  I would have:
;; 
;; 1) Intentional Aspirations of Virtue X
;; 2) Indicators or Symptoms of Virtue X
